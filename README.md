# Todo List Console Application

## Overview

This is a simple, yet powerful console-based Todo List application developed as part of the Ultimate C# Masterclass on Udemy. The application provides a straightforward interface for managing todos with core functionality to add, view, and remove tasks.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Create new tasks with unique descriptions
- **View Todos**: List all current todos with indexed numbering
- **Remove Todos**: Delete specific todos by their index
